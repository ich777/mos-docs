## Disable MD5 Verification

MOS performs MD5 checksum verification on boot to ensure data integrity
from image, rootfs and drivers image during boot.
In advanced scenarios, this verification can be explicitly disabled.

### How to Disable MD5 Checks

- Create the following file on the system:

  ```
  /boot/config/system/md5check_disabled
  ```

- The file may be empty or contain any content

- The existence of the file alone is sufficient


- Once this file exists, MD5 verification is completely disabled

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Disabling MD5 checks is intended for advanced users only


- Use this option only if you fully understand the implications

## ✅ Summary

- MD5 verification can be disabled via a marker file

- File path: /boot/config/system/md5check_disabled

- File content is irrelevant

- Recommended only for special scenarios
