# 🚀 Next-Gen OS for Storage, Containers & Virtualization

Our new operating system **MOS** combines powerful features from storage management, containerization, and virtualization — all in a modern, easy-to-use platform.

# 🧱 Flexible Storage-Pools

Multiple drives can be combined into dynamic pools, even if they have different capacities. The system adapts to your hardware and gives you maximum flexibility when expanding your setup.

# 🐳 Containers & Virtual Machines

Manage Docker containers, create LXC containers, or run full virtual machines — all within a unified environment, without the need for additional tools.

# 📁 NAS functions included

Create shared folders, manage users, and assign granular permissions. The system works perfectly as a central file and network solution.

# 🧩 Powered by Devuan

The platform is built on a stable Linux foundation and is currently in active early development. New features and improvements are added continuously.

# 🌐 Fully controllable via WebUI & API

The entire system is managed through a modern WebUI or alternatively via SSH.
Behind the scenes, the interface communicates exclusively through a powerful, extensive API — ideal for automation, integrations, and custom tooling.
