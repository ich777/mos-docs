# Docker Local Host Access (Host Shim)

When using Docker containers in **LAN network modes** (e.g. `br0` / `eth0` with `macvlan` or `ipvlan`), containers may not be able to reach the host system directly.

The **Docker Local Host Access** plugin solves this by creating a small **shim interface** on the host, enabling containers on these LAN networks to access the MOS host.

---

## ✅ What Changed?

This feature was previously provided as a manual script (`shim_bridge.sh`).

It is now shipped as an official **MOS Plugin**:
- No manual script setup
- No Cron job required
- Install once → active automatically
- Release selection is handled via MOS Hub (like any other plugin)

---

## 📍 Where to Find the Plugin

**MOS Hub → Search**
