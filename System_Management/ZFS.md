# 💾 ZFS

MOS provides optional support for ZFS via a plugin.
ZFS is ***currently available CLI only*** and is intended for users who are already familiar with managing ZFS pools manually.

ZFS support is provided as an optional feature, while further integration remains planned for the future and is not a high priority item.

---

## 🔌 OpenZFS Driver Plugin

ZFS support in MOS is enabled through the OpenZFS Driver plugin.

GitHub repository:

https://github.com/ich777/mos-openzfs-driver


The plugin installs the required OpenZFS kernel modules and CLI tools.

---

## 📦 Installation

- Open the MOS WebUI and navigate to the MOS Hub

- Search for OpenZFS Driver

- Select the desired release version (newest is preferred)

- Install the plugin

Once installed, ZFS tools such as ```zpool``` and ```zfs``` become available on the system.

---

## 🖥️ Usage (CLI)

ZFS is ***(currently)*** CLI only

No graphical management interface is provided in the MOS WebUI

ZFS pools must be created manually by the user

Example:

```zpool create tank /dev/sdX```

---

## 🔁 Boot Behavior

The ZFS is loaded on boot

Existing ZFS pools are automatically imported during boot

The OpenZFS Driver plugin must be installed for this behavior

---

## ℹ️ Notes

ZFS is a powerful and flexible filesystem and is fully usable in MOS via the CLI.
