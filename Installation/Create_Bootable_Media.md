# 🔧 Create Bootable Media

The installation process is intentionally kept simple.
 
Follow these steps to prepare a bootable USB drive:

1. Prepare the USB Stick

   Format a USB stick as FAT32 and set the label/name to ```MOS```.

2. Download the Installation Files

    Download the latest version of the system (.zip Archive) from the [Releases](https://github.com/ich777/mos-releases/releases) from the **Assets** section.

3. Extract the Files

    Extract the downloaded archive directly onto the USB stick.

    No additional imaging tools or software are required.

4. Boot from the USB Stick

    Insert the USB stick into the target machine, select it in the boot menu, and the installation process can begin immediately.

5. A network connection will be needed to access the WebUI to set initial account passwords.
