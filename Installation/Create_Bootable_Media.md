# 🔧 Create Bootable Media

The installation process is intentionally kept simple.
Follow these steps to prepare a bootable USB drive:

---

### 1. 🖴 Prepare the USB Stick

Format a USB stick as FAT32 and set the label/name to `MOS`.

> Minimum recommended size: **8 GB** (16 GB recommended to be on the safe side).

---

### 2. ⬇️ Download the Installation Files

Download the latest version of the system (`.zip` archive) from the [Releases](https://github.com/ich777/mos-releases/releases) page — Assets section.

---

### 3. 📦 Extract the Files

Extract the downloaded archive directly onto the USB stick.

> No additional imaging tools or software are required.

---

### 4. 🔌 Boot from the USB Stick

Insert the USB stick into the target machine, select it in the boot menu, and the installation process can begin immediately.

---

### 5. ✅ Complete the Setup

A network connection will be needed to access the WebUI to set initial account passwords.

Access the WebUI via:

```
http://MOS-IP/
```

> 💡 **Note:** While a USB stick is recommended, you can also use an external hard drive or card reader as long as it is formatted as FAT32.
